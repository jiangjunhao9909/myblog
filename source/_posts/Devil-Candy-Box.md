This is a candy box designed for young people's social games. The two-color candy represents punishment and reward respectively, and is randomly selected. The overall shape of the shell comes from the common dice in the game, and the sugar storage box is the shape of the devil. After shaking the sugar box, the user can pour the candy out of the devil's eyes by dumping the sugar box, which can be used as a punishment mechanism in social games or to expand game playing methods.
### SHAPE
The whole shape is inspired by the devil in the box. The overall shell is in the form of Dicer, while the sugar outlet is in the shape of a small devil. The candy is poured out of the devil's eyes, so it is called the devil's pupil.
### STRUCTURE
The inside of the sugar box is provided with a buckle structure to ensure that the internal sugar storage box will not be thrown out when dumping. At the same time, in the closed state, the overall sugar box is similar to the shape of the chromophore, which is convenient for users to shake.
### TASTE
The two kinds of candy in the sugar box have totally different tastes. Black pupil selects bitter herbs as inner core, while white pupil selects sweet herbs as inner core. Through the selection of tonic herbs, users can also get extra body care when playing games
