**A Method of Establishing Evaluation Model of Online Teaching Interactive Behavior**

Journal Titleï¼š2020 13th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design

DOI: 10.1109/ISCID51228.2020.00056

 This paper aims to establish the online education  interaction triangle model and the online education  interaction evaluation model between the teacher, the  student, and the computer, and demonstrate its feasibility. It  elaborates the interactive relationship formed by the  teaching media (computer) under the online education  environment and evaluates the interaction in the existing  online teaching by establishing and quantifying the  interactive evaluation index in the online interaction,  identifying the validity of the interaction, establishing the  index system, and evaluating the resulting base. The purpose  of this paper is to provide model support for the existing  evaluation of online teaching to help improve the current  online teaching interaction of lower quality.
